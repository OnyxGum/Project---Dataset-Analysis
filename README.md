Project Overview

This project analyzes the Kaggle dataset **“Students’ Achievements in Exams”** to explore how demographic and socioeconomic factors influence academic performance. The analysis is performed using Python inside a Jupyter Notebook and includes visualizations, statistical summaries, and insights aimed at supporting educational decision-making.

The dataset includes student scores in Math, Reading, and Writing, along with information such as gender, parental education level, lunch type, and completion of a test preparation course.

Research Questions
The analysis answers the following questions:

1. Does completing the test preparation course improve exam scores?
2. Do male and female students perform differently across subjects?
3. How does parental education level influence student performance?
4. Does lunch type (standard vs free/reduced) affect exam results?
5. Which subjects are most strongly correlated with each other?

Each question is answered using Python code, data grouping, summary statistics, and charts.
